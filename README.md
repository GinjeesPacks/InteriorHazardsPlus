### InteriorHazardsPlus
---  
> - *This is a Configuration mod to adjust how many interior hazards spawn on the map*.

> - This mod works for vanilla and modded moons.
> - The SpikeTraps don't seem to work with custom interiors or at least some of them.
> - The Config automatically recognizes when a new moon has been loaded and applies my default set configs for it. If you prefer to change the configs just `BEWARE` maxing out the configs will make the game basically unplayable. You can set everything to max but i wouldn't advise it. 

# Future Updates
---
> - The only current issue is SpikeTraps not spawning on some custom interiors for modded moons.
> - I want to add weather inside like rain, stormy(lightning).
> - Possibly add completely new hazards if I can figure that out.
> - Please make request or share your ideas, all are welcome.

**Thanks**
